        <h3>General</h3>

        <p>The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) is a distributed data system providing access to information
            resources related to geothermal energy from a network of data providers. Data are contributed by academic
            researchers, private industry, and state and federal agencies. Built on a scalable and open platform through
            the U.S. Geoscience Information Network (USGIN), NGDS respects data provenance while promoting shared
            resources. Since NGDS is built using a set of open protocols and standards, relying on the Open Geospatial
            Consortium (OGC) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO), members of the community may
            access the data in a variety of proprietary and open-source applications and software. In addition,
            developers can add functionality to the system by creating new applications based on the open protocols and
            standards of the NGDS.</p>

        <p>The NGDS, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technology Program, is intended to provide
            access to all types of geothermal data to enable geothermal analysis and widespread public use in an effort
            to reduce the risk of geothermal energy development.</p>
			
		<p>This website, the NGDS Node-in-a-Box, is a CKAN extension designed to facilitate user access to NGDS data resources by providing a search interface for the NGDS metadata catalog. The NGDS metadata catalog is a collection of metadata records that describe NGDS data resources; users can use these metadata records to locate and access the data resources described by these metadata records. In addition, the NGDS Node-in-a-Box provides users with utilities that can be used to create and manage metadata records within the NGDS metadata catalog.</p>

        <h3>Searching</h3>

        <p>The NGDS Node-in-a-Box provides access to a metadata catalog that allows users to search for NGDS data resources based on <em>metadata</em>.</p>
		<p>Metadata is used to describe and organize data resources; the NGDS metadata catalog allows the user to query and access metadata records. Each metadata record in the NGDS metadata catalog describes an NGDS data resource in ways that help users locate and access that resource. To find NGDS data resources, users search the NGDS metadata catalog for the metadata records that describe these resources.</p>

        <h3>Library</h3>
		<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/images/help/catalog.PNG" style="float: inherit;" width="66%"></img></p>
        <p>The <strong>Library</strong> page acts as a keyword search interface of the NGDS metadata catalog. Here, users can search through NGDS metadata records by keyword and filter the results based on criteria that expand as more metadata records are added to the catalog. Search results can be filtered by multiple criteria simultaneously.</p>
		
		<p>To filter a search, click the filter criteria on the left side of the screen to expand them; click the check box by each desired filter. Filter criteria are as follows:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Category</strong>: Filter results by category and subcategory. For example, one category is drilling technology, which includes a variety of subcategories related to drilling, such as the presence or absence of casing diagrams. Clicking the checkbox associated with any these subcategories will exclude any datasets that do not include the indicated  information.</li>
		<li><strong>Format</strong>: Filter results by dataset format; formats include data types and online resources, such as web services. Clicking the checkbox associated with any of these formats will exclude any datasets that do not match the indicated format(s).</li>
		<li><strong>Source & Author</strong>: Filter results by source and-or author. Clicking the checkbox associated with a specific source or author will exclude any datasets not submitted by the indicated source(s) or author(</li>
		<li><strong>Status</strong>: Filter results by the status of the dataset within the context of the NGDS project. Dataset status tends to reflect the state of completion of the dataset; for example, typical NGDS datasets will be either completed, ongoing, or deprecated. Clicking the checkbox associated within a given state will exclude any datasets that fall outside the selected state.</li>
		<li><strong>Content Model</strong>: Filter results by the content model to which the dataset conforms. Each NGDS dataset conforms to a specific content model. Clicking the checkbox beside a specific content model will exclude any datasets that do not conform to the indicated content model(s).</li>
		<li><strong>Public/Private</strong>: Filter results by the visibility of the dataset. When published, users can designate whether or not a given dataset is publicly accessible of listed privately. Clicking the appropriate checkbox will exclude datasets on the basis of whether or not they are public or private.</li>
