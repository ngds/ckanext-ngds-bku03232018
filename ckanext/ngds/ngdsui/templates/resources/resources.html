                - The Geothermal Prospector is a mapping tool developed for the Geothermal Power industry.
                This tool is designed to help developers' site large-scale geothermal plants by providing easy access
                to geothermal resource datasets and other data relevant to utility-scale geothermal power projects.
                Geothermal Prospector can pull NGDS WMS/WFS datasets into the viewer to help enable exploration.

            <p><a href="http://data.geothermaldatasystem.org/">NGDS Data Explorer</a>
                - This program searches the NGDS for geothermal features based on a keyword and/or defined map extent.
                It then displays the features on a map, allows for the selection of features, and can create a table
                of selected features which can be displayed as an HTML table or downloaded as a CSV or Excel file.

                - One of the NGDS goals is to reduce the risks and the costs of finding and
                characterizing geothermal resources while optimizing management and expansion of known
                geothermal fields. GeoFRAT is a widget for NGDS that helps users assess the research potential and
                financial risks that may be associated with producing electricity from that resource. GeoFRAT when
                used in conjunction with other widgets and tools such as the
                <a href="http://www1.eere.energy.gov/geothermal/getem.html">GETEM</a>,
                Geochemistry WorkBench etc can help in performing detailed risk analysis for a geothermal resource

                Geothermal Electricity Technology Evaluation Model</a>
                (GETEM) - this tool aids the U.S. Department of Energy's Geothermal Technologies Office in
                understanding the performance and the cost of the technologies it is seeking to improve.
                It is a detailed model of the estimated performance and costs of currently available U.S.
                geothermal power systems. GETEM can be used to analyze and evaluate currently available technologies
                and to estimate the cost of certain technologies five to 20 years in the future, given the direction of
                potential RD&amp;D projects. The model is intended to help GTO determine which proposed RD&amp;D
                programs and projects might offer the most improvements for the taxpayer dollar.

            <p>This section provides a brief introduction for available applications that are available to view NGDS
                data; this list is not exhaustive and should be used as an introduction to the breadth of applicable
                products available. If you would like to develop an application for the NGDS,
                <a href="/ngds/develop">click here</a>. Each of these applications includes basic instructions on how
                to view NGDS data.&nbsp; The first step for all applications is to find a Web Map Services (WMS) data
                using the Catalog search pages at either the <a href="/ngds/map">Map</a> or the
                <a href="/dataset">Library</a> search interface.</p>
            <ol>
                <li> Type in a keyword such as location (e.g., state name). This will bring up a list of services
                    available.
                </li>
                <li> Click any WMS service, which will cause a pop-up on the map. From that pop-up select the name of
                    the service, then WMS. WMS services are displayed similar to:

    <p><strong>Additional applications to view and analyze USGIN data include:</strong></p>

    <p><a href="http://www.worldwidetelescope.org/Home.aspx" target="_blank">Worldwide Telescope</a>
        - WWT is an application that runs in Windows that utilizes images and data stored on remote servers. This
        application does not yet support WMS, but a Microsoft Excel Add-in is available. This can be used to load
        location and time-based data into the WWT visualization environment, though the set-up can be extensive.
        Such data, for example, can include latitude, longitude, magnitude, and depth for earthquakes. For more
        information on importing Excel data,
        see <a href="http://www.layerscape.org/Content/Index/453" target="_blank">http://www.layerscape.org/Content/Index/453</a>.</p>

    <p><a href="http://i-gis.dk/Home/tabid/40/language/en-GB/Default.aspx" target="_blank">GeoScene 3D</a>
        - GeoScene3D is an application for 2D and 3D visualizing, interpreting, editing and publishing geological data,
        including drill or bore holes, terrain, and geologic units. This application is intended for 3D viewing, so
        there is not an extensive base map selection. Although additional steps are required to view AASG WMS features
        in 3D in this application, it is WMS-aware.
        <ol>
            <li>Download the software. To begin a project from USGIN WMS, from the smaller "Map" window, click the add data icon.</li>
            <li>Choose Web Service.</li>
            <li>Paste the WMS URL into the box (e.g.,
