<h2>About NGDS</h2>

<p>The National Geothermal Data System (NGDS) is a distributed data system providing access to information resources
    related to geothermal energy from a network of data providers. Data are contributed by academic researchers, private
    industry, and state and federal agencies. Built on a scalable and open platform through the U.S. Geoscience
    Information Network (USGIN), NGDS respects data provenance while promoting shared resources. Since NGDS is built
    using a set of open protocols and standards, relying on the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) and International
    Organization for Standardization (ISO), members of the community may access the data in a variety of proprietary and
    open-source applications and software. In addition, developers can add functionality to the system by creating new
    applications based on the open protocols and standards of the NGDS.</p>

<p>The NGDS, supported by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Geothermal Technology Program, is intended to provide access
    to all types of geothermal data to enable geothermal analysis and widespread public use in an effort to reduce the
    risk of geothermal energy development.</p>
